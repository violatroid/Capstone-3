                            ****** This Project is about a blogging website with other users ******
This blog is designed and inspired off today's society. Social media today cen be very posisitive but also can be a extremely negative influental space. This site is a social site that everyone should feel free to vent and to feel heard. Mental health matters and this site is to help you not feel alone. By venting you will feel more self aware and be emotional mindful. We also provide a free number to call if you are experiencing a mental health crisis.
